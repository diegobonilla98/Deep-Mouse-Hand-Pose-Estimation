# Deep-Mouse-Hand-Pose-Estimation
Mouse controller based on hand pose estimation


To test it make sure your hand is clear and facing the webcam. Leave your index finger pointing up.


### Actual Fatures:
- **Move Mouse**: Just move the index finger arround.
- **Click**: Join your thumb and index finger.
- **Double Click**: Same as **click** but maintain it for longer time.
- **Scroll**: Join your index and middle finger and move the hand up/down slightly.


### Output

No video. To-do tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next.


## Warning!
This is some scripts I've made for tests and/or meaningless projects. They are not made to be easy to understand, optimized nor working. They surely have some interesting stuff so for any questions please talk to me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).
